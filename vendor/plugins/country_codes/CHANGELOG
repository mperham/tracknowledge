========================================

Revision 4:
  * Added countries_for_select method, which takes parameters for a resulting
    array for use in a select tag
    
    countries_for_select('a2', 'name')   # yields something like [ ['AU', 'Australia'] ...lots more... ]

========================================

Revision 4:
  * Added CHANGELOG
  * Added support for methods of the form find_ATTRIBUTE_by_ATTRIBUTE such as:
    
    find_a2_by_name('Australia')     # yields 'AU', which is equivilant to
    find_by_name('Australia')[:a2]   # yields 'AU' also.
    
  * Tests updated to support methods of the form find_ATTRIBUTE_by_ATTRIBUTE
